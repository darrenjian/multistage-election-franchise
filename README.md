State Policies and the US Election Franchise: A Multistage Approach
NaLette Brodnax, Darren Jian

About the Project:
* Create an original, heterogenous dataset from merging county-level US election survey data from the US Election Assistance Commission, individual state-level policies and state partisanship data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, and demographic data from the US Census Bureau API.
* Develop a multilevel regression model to estimate the effects of state election policies on registration and turnout in U.S. presidential elections.
* Examine predicted impact of race, gender, income, age, education, state partisanship, employment, and felon status.

Findings:
* Initial model results show all-mail voting and same day voter registration have a statistically significant positive effect on turnout
* Strict ID, photo ID, and felon voting laws had no statistically significant effect on turnout
* Although there was wide variation among states when it came to voter registration and early voting laws, Democratic-leaning states generally exhibited fewer voter ID requirements and fewer restrictions on felon voting
