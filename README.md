State Policies and the US Election Franchise: A Multistage Approach
NaLette Brodnax, Darren Jian

* Create an original, heterogenous dataset from merging county-level US election survey data from the US Election Assistance Commission, individual state-level policies and state partisanship data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, and demographic data from the US Census Bureau API.
* Develop a multilevel regression model to estimate the effects of state election policies on registration and turnout in U.S. presidential elections.
* Examine predicted impact of race, gender, income, age, education, state partisanship, employment, and felon status.
